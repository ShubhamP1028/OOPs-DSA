    "In Python, an Abstract Base Class (ABC) is used to achieve data abstraction by defining a common interface for its subclasses. It cannot be instantiated directly and serves as a blueprint for other classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract classes are created using abc module and @abstractmethod decorator, allowing developers to enforce method implementation in subclasses while hiding complex internal logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>Components of Abstraction</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "* <b>Abstract Method</b> : Abstract methods are method declarations without a body defined inside an abstract class. They act as placeholders that force subclasses to provide their own specific implementation, ensuring consistent structure across derived classes.\n",
    "* <b>Concrete Method</b>: Concrete methods are fully implemented methods within an abstract class. Subclasses can inherit and use them directly, promoting code reuse without needing to redefine common functionality.\n",
    "* <b>Abstract Properties</b> : Abstract properties work like abstract methods but are used for properties. These properties are declared with @property decorator and marked as abstract using @abstractmethod. Subclasses must implement these properties.\n",
    "* <b>Abstract Class Instantiation</b> :Abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly. This is because they contain one or more abstract methods or properties that lack implementations. Attempting to instantiate an abstract class results in a TypeError.\n",
